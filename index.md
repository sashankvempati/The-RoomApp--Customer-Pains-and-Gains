# What are my cutomer pains and gains?

### Pain points

Based on my observation, I came up with the hypothesis that it is not always guaranted that you would be able to find a private space at your preferred time on the same day, or even the day after.

This would be further challenging for people in a group setting when they want to get work done in a quiet or private environment, because they may have limited overlapping of their available times. The limited timings of privatelibrary study spaces would further hinder the group's availability of being able to meet in person. This is why I came up with this model of hosting workspaces in residential homes, so that there would be more availability of different types of spaces 24/7.

Another challenge with library study spaces is that you often have a limit of 2-3 hours per reservation before renewing it. Even this won't guarantee that you would be able to extend the length of the room reservation. This service lets you reserve a workspace for however long you need, whether it is for an hour or the entire day.

The only amenities available are generally basic, and even some of them (like whiteboards and external displays) won't always be available.


### Gains

This service provides an alternative to library study spaces, in that there would be more availability, flexibility, and scalability of these private spaces.

Being in residential houses, it will be a lot easier to scale based on how much user demand there is. Also, since there won't be as much maintenance costs compared to a commercial building, the cost of the service would be a lot more affordable.
